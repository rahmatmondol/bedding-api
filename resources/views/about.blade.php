                            <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
                            This Privacy Policy explains how Dirham ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and discloses
                            information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Dirham is a service-based
                            platform that connects customers with service providers through a bidding system.

                            By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not
                            agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.
                            <h2><b>Information We Collect</b></h2>
                            <h3><b>Personal Data</b></h3>
                            The App may collect and process the following types of personal data:
                            <ul>
                                <li aria-level="1"><b>Account Information</b>: When you create an account, we collect
                                    your name, email address, profile information, and user credentials.</li>
                                <li aria-level="1"><b>User Content</b>: Information you provide when posting jobs,
                                    submitting bids, or communicating with other users.</li>
                                <li aria-level="1"><b>Device Information</b>: We collect information about your mobile
                                    device, including device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers,
